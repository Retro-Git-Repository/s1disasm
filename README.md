s1disasm_git
============

The very latest Sonic 1 Disassembly.

See: http://info.sonicretro.org/Disassemblies

This branch has been modified to use Sonic 2's 128x128 chunk and path-swapper systems. Modifications originally made by MarkeyJester. Updated by kram1024/kramlat/kraminator to target AS instead of asm68k.

This branch uses macros in the place of sprite mappings.

This branch has special features based on existing guides and is meant to speed up the development of a hack.
Beginners, I suggest you use one of the other disassemblies available instead since this will likely cause you to skip guides that could be valuable experience with hacking.

This branch will use all the guides that can:

* be applied without requiring the changing out of levels or music
* actually have asm in the hack, not just hex editing.
* are trivial hacks that waste time having to impliment that could be used for something better.
* must be a bug fix or feature.

To enable a feature or disable it, edit Kraminator.s.

If it does not fit the criteria of the feature set above, then either use the guide, or remember how to do it yourself. For anything not in a guide, you are on your own here.
